Before `node.js` really executes any script,
It'll check your command line (a rudimentary
way.. before any 'utility/getopt' usage..)..

The supported parameters are encoded in this
`node.js` file, and they're:

	# --lib-version / --library-version

		ONLY prints out the current
		Library.js version.

	# --lib-config / --library-config

		Should accept a path param,
		override default config.js.

	# --lib-trace / --library-trace

		As I remember it should set
		the 'Error.stackTraceLimit'
		to Infinity.

		Ya should be able to change
		this value via CONFIG.TRACE
		and so environment variable
		'trace'.

NOT available if you start your scripts via
regular Node.js' `node` process (where this
Library.js needs to be require()'d THEN and
ONLY THEN).
