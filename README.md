## Library
Everything (now only NON-browser) in the '**lib.js**/' directory.

### Test cases
See the '**test.js**/' directory.

### Installation
There's a script for root and non-root installation (and additionally for
[https://termux.dev/](Termux)), which is just extending the `${PATH}`
environment variable to your `${PREFIX}/usr/bin/`, where the `node.js`
file is linked.

The `node.js` is the file for your script's '[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)](Shebang)'s,
or just to call it with either a script path or by passing your JavaScript code via a regular pipe! ^\_^
